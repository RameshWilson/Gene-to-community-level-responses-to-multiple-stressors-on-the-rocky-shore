## Third-party datasets and derivatives (not covered by CC BY 4.0)

### 1) Visual Crossing precipitation (not redistributed here)
Precipitation used for the SI figure was obtained from **Visual Crossing** (downloaded during a time-limited paid subscription).

**This repository does not redistribute:**
- raw Visual Crossing downloads (daily CSV time series), or
- any Visual Crossing-hosted datasets.

This is to comply with Visual Crossing’s terms and conditions: https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-services-terms/

**To fully reproduce the figure if desired:**
- Use Visual Crossing’s query builder (or another provider) to download the same daily time window and location, then save it locally as `Dataframes/Precipitation data.csv`, and run `Additional analyses/Precipitation x sewage releases_Additional.R`.

### 2) Southern Water “Rivers and Seas Watch” sewage release events (source attribution)
Sewage release event data were downloaded from Southern Water’s **Rivers and Seas Watch** portal (publicly accessible; includes a downloadable table of results): https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/e9a1db8d193d4cd582d550285a3aeb44/page/Release-History?views=Live-updates

**Important note on reuse:**
- This repository does not grant any licence over Southern Water data.
- If you reuse sewage release data, you should attribute **Southern Water / Rivers and Seas Watch** and check any applicable terms or usage statements associated with the portal/API.
